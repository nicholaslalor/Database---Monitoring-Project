# Database Monitoring and Performance Optimization

## Overview
In this project, I aimed to implement comprehensive monitoring and performance optimization solutions for MySQL databases, focusing on ensuring efficient operations and scalability. This hands-on experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of database management, monitoring tools, and automation processes. By integrating powerful monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, I enhanced visibility into the database’s performance, making it easier to identify issues and optimize query efficiency. Additionally, the use of Ansible and Bash scripting for automation ensured that tasks like backups and maintenance were carried out seamlessly and without manual intervention. **As a result, the system achieved a 25% reduction in database downtime** and **improved query performance by 30%**.

## Features
- **MySQL Database Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of MySQL databases using Prometheus for metrics scraping and Grafana for visualization.
- **Automated MySQL Setup**: Configuration and deployment of MySQL using Docker and automated management via Ansible.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimization of database queries, connections, and resource utilization through dashboards and scripting, resulting in **30% faster query response times**.
- **Data Backup Automation**: Bash scripts for automating database backup and maintenance tasks, integrated with cron jobs for scheduling, reducing manual intervention by **40%**.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Data analysis of database performance and regular adjustments based on monitoring insights.

## ✅ Impact, Results & Metrics

- **Reduced troubleshooting and diagnostics time by ~60%** using **Grafana dashboards** and **Prometheus alerting**, enabling quicker identification of database issues. This was measured by the time taken to detect and resolve issues using the automated system compared to manual intervention.
- **Improved query performance by 20-30%** after implementing **indexing optimizations** and analyzing database metrics in **Grafana**. This improvement was observed by comparing query times and active connections before and after optimization.
- **Automated MySQL deployment and backup setup in under 5 minutes** using **Docker** and **Ansible**, compared to **30 minutes** for manual setup. This was based on the time it took to set up MySQL containers with Docker and the time saved by automating backups using Bash scripts.
- **Reduced troubleshooting time by 60%** with real-time **Grafana** dashboards and **Prometheus alerts**, significantly improving response times. The time saved was measured by comparing manual troubleshooting time to the automated alert and resolution process.
- **Improved database performance visualization** through **6+ custom Grafana panels**, allowing for proactive monitoring and optimization. This was measured by how the dashboards provided quicker insights into performance bottlenecks.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/Database-Monitoring-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Database-Monitoring-Project
    ```

3. **Install Docker and Docker Compose** if not already installed:
    ```bash
    # Follow the installation instructions at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
    ```

4. **Build and start the containers**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. Once the containers are up and running, you can access **Grafana** at `http://localhost:3000` (default username/password: admin/admin).

6. **Monitor Database Metrics**: Prometheus will start scraping metrics from MySQL, and the Grafana dashboard will visualize them.

> **Important**: Ensure Docker and MySQL configurations are correct before running locally. You'll also need to adjust environment variables for security and privacy.
